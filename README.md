# 3D Barcode Scanner

This project is a powerful, feature-rich barcode scanner with a modern 3D UI built using Python, PyQt6, OpenCV, and Qt3D. It combines a live camera feed for real-time barcode detection with an interactive 3D scene.

## Features

- **Real-Time Barcode Detection**: Scans barcodes from a live camera feed.
- **Image Barcode Scanning**: Allows loading an image file to scan for barcodes.
- **3D Interactive UI**: Embeds a rotating 3D cube using Qt3D.
- **Clear Results**: Easily reset the scanned barcode data.
- **Modern & Sleek Design**: Built with PyQt6 for a modern user experience.
